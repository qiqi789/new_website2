  abstract  = {We present two heuristics for feature selection based on entropy and mutual information criteria, respectively. The mutual-information-based selection algorithm exploiting its submodularity retrieves near-optimal solutions guaranteed by a theoretical lower bound. We demonstrate that these heuristic-based methods can reduce the dimensionality of classification problems by filtering out half of its features in the meantime still improving classification accuracy. Experimental results also show that the mutual-information-based heuristic will most likely collaborate well with classifiers when selecting about a half size of features, while the entropy-based heuristic will help most in the early stage of selection when choosing a relatively small percentage of features. We also demonstrate a remarkable case of feature selection being used in classification on a medical dataset, where it can potentially save half of the cost on the diabetes diagnosis.},

  title    = {Modified Remora Optimization Algorithm for Global Optimization and Multilevel Thresholding Image Segmentation},
  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {Image segmentation is a key stage in image processing because it simplifies the representation of the image and facilitates subsequent analysis. The multi-level thresholding image segmentation technique is considered one of the most popular methods because it is efficient and straightforward. Many relative works use meta-heuristic algorithms (MAs) to determine threshold values, but they have issues such as poor convergence accuracy and stagnation into local optimal solutions. Therefore, to alleviate these shortcomings, in this paper, we present a modified remora optimization algorithm (MROA) for global optimization and image segmentation tasks. We used Brownian motion to promote the exploration ability of ROA and provide a greater opportunity to find the optimal solution. Second, lens opposition-based learning is introduced to enhance the ability of search agents to jump out of the local optimal solution. To substantiate the performance of MROA, we first used 23 benchmark functions to evaluate the performance. We compared it with seven well-known algorithms regarding optimization accuracy, convergence speed, and significant difference. Subsequently, we tested the segmentation quality of MORA on eight grayscale images with cross-entropy as the objective function. The experimental metrics include peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structure similarity (SSIM), and feature similarity (FSIM). A series of experimental results have proved that the MROA has significant advantages among the compared algorithms. Consequently, the proposed MROA is a promising method for global optimization problems and image segmentation.},

  abstract = {Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) is a physically inspired optimization algorithm that mimics arithmetic operators in mathematical calculation. Although the AOA has an acceptable exploration and exploitation ability, it also has some shortcomings such as low population diversity, premature convergence, and easy stagnation into local optimal solutions. The Golden Sine Algorithm (Gold-SA) has strong local searchability and fewer coefficients. To alleviate the above issues and improve the performance of AOA, in this paper, we present a hybrid AOA with Gold-SA called HAGSA for solving industrial engineering design problems. We divide the whole population into two subgroups and optimize them using AOA and Gold-SA during the searching process. By dividing these two subgroups, we can exchange and share profitable information and utilize their advantages to find a satisfactory global optimal solution. Furthermore, we used the Levy flight and proposed a new strategy called Brownian mutation to enhance the searchability of the hybrid algorithm. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed work, HAGSA, we selected the CEC 2014 competition test suite as a benchmark function and compared HAGSA against other well-known algorithms. Moreover, five industrial engineering design problems were introduced to verify the ability of algorithms to solve real-world problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed work HAGSA is significantly better than original AOA, Gold-SA, and other compared algorithms in terms of optimization accuracy and convergence speed.},

First, the tent map is used to increase the population diversity in the initial phase. Second, the quasi reflection-based learning is introduced to increase the ability of exploitation. Finally, the performance of QRSMA is evaluated through assorted tests including thirteen benchmark functions and one engineering design problem against other four well-known optimization algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate better performances of the proposed QRSMA in exploring capability and convergence quality than other algorithms.},

Attention Gates (AGs) are introduced in the decoding stage to increase the relevance of feature weighting in accord with segmentation tasks. The proposed method has been evaluated through a set of real world medical images including 22 organs at risk in the head and neck. Experimental results showed that our proposed method improved the average segmentation accuracy by 3-4% compared with current existing methods. The average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score on the segmentation of the 22 types of head-and-neck related organs at risk is 79.5% and the average 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) is 6.99mm.

  abstract = {Multilevel thresholding is one of the most commonly used methods in image segmentation. However, the exhaustive search methods are costly in determining optimal thresholds and the conventional remora optimization algorithm (ROA) is prone to the premature convergence. This paper presents a chimp-inspired remora optimization algorithm (HCROA) to search optimal threshold levels, and the cross-entropy is employed as the objective function. In HCROA, the particles’ position are adjusted by the Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) because of its good exploitation ability and sufficient diversity. With this change, HCROA achieves both the intra-group diversity intelligence and a suitable balance between exploration and exploitation. To validate its performance, a series of experiments are performed. First, we test the HCROA’s segmentation accuracy by a set of natural gray-scale images with different thresholds. Second, HCROA is implemented for noisy image segmentation to evaluate its robustness. Several reference-based measurements including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Feature Similarity (FSIM), Quality Index based on Local Variance (QILV), Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity Index (HPSI), Wilcoxon test, and CPU time have been considered for evaluating the proposed method. Additionally, eight well-known predecessors are injected for parallel comparison. The comparison results prove that the suggested method outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, noise robustness, and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Accurate diabetes diagnosis and readmission prediction are crucial for effective patient health management. In this paper, we developed an Adaptive Multi-Channel Fusion Network (AMCFN). Specifically, we have defined a feature enhancement module that combines an attention mechanism to dynamically assign relevant weights to input data, thereby enabling the model to focus on processing task-relevant inputs. Meanwhile, we designed a multi-channel fusion network that utilizes various network architectures to simultaneously extract diverse deep features from the input data and concatenate these features. Finally, we use multiple kernel functions to map the fused features into different feature spaces, and combine their outputs through weighted sum into a new matrix for the final prediction task. Extensive experiments were conducted on the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD), the Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset (ESDRPD) and the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008 Dataset (D130-US). Our model outperforms existing baseline models in diabetes diagnosis and readmission prediction. The ablation experiment also demonstrates the effectiveness of the design of each module. Our research provided improved clinical decision support for diabetes diagnosis and readmission prediction, with the potential to reduce the waste of medical resources.},
