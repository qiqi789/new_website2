@article{Curry2022,
	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis and multiparametric programming in optimization modeling study variations of optimal value and solutions in the presence of uncertain input parameters. In this paper, we consider simultaneous variations in the inputs of the objective and constraint (jointly called the RIM parameters), where the uncertainty is represented as a multivariate probability distribution. We introduce a tolerance approach based on principal component analysis, which obtains a tolerance region that is suited to the given distribution and can be considered a confidence set for the random input parameters. Since a tolerance region may contain parameters with different optimal bases, we extend the tolerance approach to the case where multiple optimal bases cover the tolerance region, by studying theoretical properties of critical regions (defined as the set of input parameters having the same optimal basis). We also propose a computational algorithm to find critical regions covering a given tolerance region in the RIM parameter space. Our theoretical results on geometric properties of critical regions contribute to the existing theory of parametric programming with an emphasis on the case where RIM parameters vary jointly, and provide deeper geometric understanding of critical regions. We evaluate the proposed framework using a series of experiments for sensitivity analysis, for model predictive control of an inventory management problem, and for large optimization problem instances.},

	abstract = {We propose Factual News Graph (FANG), a novel graphical social context representation and learning framework for fake news detection. Unlike previous contextual models that have targeted performance, our focus is on representation learning. Compared to transductive models, FANG is scalable in training as it does not have to maintain the social entities involved in the propagation of other news and is efficient at inference time, without the need to reprocess the entire graph. Our experimental results show that FANG is better at capturing the social context into a high-fidelity representation, compared to recent graphical and nongraphical models. In particular, FANG yields significant improvements for the task of fake news detection and is robust in the case of limited training data. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by FANG generalize to related tasks, such as predicting the factuality of reporting of a news medium.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems personalize content by recommending items to users. Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated by metrics that compare the positions of truly relevant items among the recommended items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates such sampled metrics in more detail and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact counterpart, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, for example, recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. Moreover, the smaller the sample size, the less difference there is between metrics, and for very small sample size, all metrics collapse to the AUC metric. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction, obtained by minimizing different criteria. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. To summarize, our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the quality of the estimate.},

  abstract   = {Similarity search is a fundamental algorithmic primitive, widely used in many computer science disciplines. Given a set of points S and a radius parameter r &gt; 0, the r-near neighbor (r-NN) problem asks for a data structure that, given any query point q, returns a point p within distance at most r from q. In this paper, we study the r-NN problem in the light of individual fairness and providing equal opportunities: all points that are within distance r from the query should have the same probability to be returned. The problem is of special interest in high dimensions, where Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), the theoretically leading approach to similarity search, does not provide any fairness guarantee. In this work, we show that LSH-based algorithms can be made fair, without a significant loss in efficiency. We propose several efficient data structures for the exact and approximate variants of the fair NN problem. Our approach works more generally for sampling uniformly from a sub-collection of sets of a given collection and can be used in a few other applications. We also carried out an experimental evaluation that highlights the inherent unfairness of existing NN data structures.},

However, the adoption of these "best practices," ranging from the use of antivirus products to keeping software updated, is not well understood, nor is their practical impact on security risk well established. To explore these issues, we conducted a large-scale measurement of 15,000 computers over six months. We use passive monitoring to infer and characterize the prevalence of various security practices as well as a range of other potentially security-relevant behaviors. We then explore the extent to which differences in key security behaviors impact the real-world outcomes (i.e., that a device shows clear evidence of having been compromised).},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to ensure group fairness in algorithmic decision making aim to equalize "total" error rates for different subgroups in the population. In contrast, we argue that the fairness approaches should instead focus only on equalizing errors arising due to model uncertainty (a.k.a epistemic uncertainty), caused due to lack of knowledge about the best model or due to lack of data. In other words, our proposal calls for ignoring the errors that occur due to uncertainty inherent in the data, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We draw a connection between predictive multiplicity and model uncertainty and argue that the techniques from predictive multiplicity could be used to identify errors made due to model uncertainty. We propose scalable convex proxies to come up with classifiers that exhibit predictive multiplicity and empirically show that our methods are comparable in performance and up to four orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art. We further pro- pose methods to achieve our goal of equalizing group error rates arising due to model uncertainty in algorithmic decision making and demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods using synthetic and real-world datasets},

@conference{Andrus2022,
	abstract = {Most proposed algorithmic fairness techniques require access to demographic data in order to make performance comparisons and standardizations across groups, however this data is largely unavailable in practice, hindering the widespread adoption of algorithmic fairness. Through this paper, we consider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic fairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with smart enough technical methods and sufficient data. We show how these techniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic oppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic processing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data should be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by characterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the risks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks of sensitive attributes, the possible harms of miscategorization and misrepresentation, and the use of sensitive data beyond data subjects' expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire groups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in the name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be part of a demographic group, and ceding the ability to define what constitutes biased or unfair treatment. We argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of oppression. Towards this end, we assess privacy-focused methods of data collection and use and participatory data governance structures as proposals for more responsibly collecting demographic data.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) transitions from research to deployment, creating the appropriate datasets and data pipelines to develop and evaluate AI models is increasingly the biggest challenge. Automated AI model builders that are publicly available can now achieve top performance in many applications. In contrast, the design and sculpting of the data used to develop AI often rely on bespoke manual work, and they critically affect the trustworthiness of the model. This Perspective discusses key considerations for each stage of the data-for-AI pipeline--starting from data design to data sculpting (for example, cleaning, valuation and annotation) and data evaluation--to make AI more reliable. We highlight technical advances that help to make the data-for-AI pipeline more scalable and rigorous. Furthermore, we discuss how recent data regulations and policies can impact AI.},
